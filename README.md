## Introduction

This is *autognomus*’ repository. *autognomus* (as in **Au**tomatic **T**ension-**O**riented **G**e**n**erator **o**f **Mus**ic) is a publicly available music generation system capable of generating tonal music that has long-term structure and matches input tension profiles.

*autognomus*’ implementation is partly based on our system [AuToTen](https://github.com/GermanRuizMarcos/AuToTen), which automatically calculates the degrees of tension in a piece of tonal music according to Fred Lerdahl’s model of tonal tension.
